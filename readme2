# HealthHub: Patient & Provider Wellness Platform

HealthHub is a modern, full-stack web application designed to bridge the gap between patients and healthcare providers. It provides a secure and scalable platform for patients to manage their health information, track wellness goals, and book appointments, while offering healthcare providers a streamlined view of their assigned patients and their scheduled consultations.

This project is built using the MERN stack and adheres to modern development practices, including a decoupled frontend and backend, RESTful API design, and a basic CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.

## Tech Stack

This project is built with a modern JavaScript-based stack, ensuring a fast, scalable, and maintainable application.

*   **Frontend**:
    *   **React.js**: A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
    *   **React Router**: For client-side routing and navigation.
    *   **Axios**: For making promise-based HTTP requests to the backend API.
    *   **CSS**: Basic styling for a clean and responsive user experience.

*   **Backend**:
    *   **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime for building the server-side application.
    *   **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
    *   **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for storing user data, profiles, and appointments.
    *   **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.

*   **Authentication**:
    *   **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**: For securing API endpoints and managing user sessions.
    *   **bcrypt.js**: For hashing user passwords before storing them in the database.

*   **DevOps**:
    *   **GitHub Actions**: For continuous integration (CI) to automate building and testing.

## Key Features

The platform is divided into two primary roles, each with a specific set of features.

### For Patients
*   **Secure Authentication**: Register and log in securely with JWT-based authentication.
*   **Consent Management**: Must provide consent for data usage during registration, a key privacy measure.
*   **Profile Management**: View and update a personal health profile, including `allergies` and `current medications`.
*   **Wellness Goal Tracking**: Create and track daily wellness goals like "Water Intake" or "Steps Taken".
*   **Appointment Booking**: Schedule new appointments with a simple and intuitive form.
*   **Personalized Dashboard**: A central hub displaying a "Health tip of the day" and access to all features.

### For Healthcare Providers
*   **Secure Authentication**: Separate login for healthcare providers.
*   **Patient Roster**: View a list of all patients assigned to them.
*   **Appointment Dashboard**: See a comprehensive list of all appointments booked by patients across the platform.
*   **Role-Based Access Control**: Access is strictly limited to provider-specific functionalities.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   **Node.js** (v16 or newer)
*   **npm** (Node Package Manager)
*   **MongoDB**: A running instance of MongoDB (either locally or on a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas).

### Backend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the server directory**:
    ```bash
    cd server
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add your MongoDB connection string.
    ```
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=a_strong_secret_key_for_jwt
    ```

4.  **Run the server**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The backend will start on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the client directory**:
    ```bash
    cd client
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the `client` directory to specify the backend API URL.
    ```
    REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
    ```

4.  **Run the client application**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The React development server will start on `http://localhost:3000`.
