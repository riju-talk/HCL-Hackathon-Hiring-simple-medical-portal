Here is a clean, professional, **submission-ready README section**, rewritten so it matches your hackathon requirements *exactly* — minimal, slick, and aligned with the features shown in your documents.
No fluff. No contradictions. No implementation promises you can’t keep.
Just a tight, judge-friendly explanation of the MVP.

# **HCL Hackathon – Simple Medical Portal**

## **Problem Statement**

The goal is to design a **Healthcare Wellness & Preventive Care Portal** that integrates a responsive front-end with a structured back-end design. The system must support two roles—**Patients** and **Healthcare Providers**—and enable secure access to wellness information, preventive-care reminders, and basic profile management.

The portal must highlight:

* Preventive-care awareness
* Personalized health insights
* Simple, secure authentication
* Role-based access
* Clear focus on **healthcare-oriented privacy principles**

This is a *design-first* MVP aimed at demonstrating feasibility, structure, and correctness rather than full enterprise implementation.

## **Core Requirements**

### **1. Responsive UI**

A mobile-first front-end design ensuring users can access dashboards and health information across devices with consistent usability.

### **2. Authentication (Mocked, Secure by Design)**

* Basic login + registration flows
* JWT-style session logic (mocked using `localStorage` for MVP demonstration)
* Role-based access controls (Patient vs Provider)
* Consent acknowledgement during registration
* Simple logging for sensitive user actions (conceptual)

### **3. Patient Dashboard**

A personalized dashboard displaying:

* Wellness goal progress (steps, sleep, active minutes)
* Preventive-care reminders (e.g., “Upcoming annual checkup”)
* A simple *“health tip of the day”* component
* Quick view of compliance status

### **4. Healthcare Provider Dashboard**

A provider-focused view supporting:

* List of assigned patients
* Patient compliance overview
* Quick access to wellness metrics and reminders

### **5. Profile Management**

Editable user profile including:

* Demographics
* Basic health information
* Contact details
* Notes (e.g., allergies, medications)

Profiles reinforce personalization while respecting minimal PHI exposure.

## **MVP Emphasis**

This MVP is built to **demonstrate the core architecture and functional flows** of a healthcare portal, not full-scale healthcare operations.

Key focus areas:

* **Security-minded design:** role-based permissions, token logic concepts, consent tracking
* **Personalization:** user-specific dashboards and metrics
* **Healthcare compliance awareness:** privacy-safe data modeling, minimal PHI handling
* **Usability:** clear navigation and responsive layout

Judges should be able to quickly understand the full system flow, login process, role separation, and data interaction.

## **Planned Pages (6 Total)**

1. **Login Page**
   User authentication with role-based routing.

2. **Registration Page**
   Account creation (Patient or Provider) with consent confirmation.

3. **Patient Dashboard**
   Wellness tracking, reminders, and personalized insights.

4. **Provider Dashboard**
   Compliance overview and patient-centric information summaries.

5. **Profile Page**
   Editable profile with basic health and personal details.

6. **Public Health Information**
    Editable profile with basic health and personal details.

These pages demonstrate all essential user journeys required by the problem statement.

---

## **Summary**

This MVP presents a clear, secure, role-aware design for a simple medical wellness and preventive-care portal. It balances functional clarity with healthcare-focused considerations, delivering a lightweight but complete demonstration of authentication, personalization, and user-centric health insights.
